# MyFirstApp
This application is for calculating a handcrew's invoice during a fire incident. This application will help with speeding up the demob process with finance and save the crew boss time with calculating an invoice.

The location of the files that contain my code for the application are in the following locations:
1. AndroidApps/MyFirstApp/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
The android manifest is for indicating which activity will be used first when the app is deployed and also the other activities that will be used for the app.
2. AndroidApps/MyfirstApp/app/src/main/res/layout
This directory contains all the layout files for the activities that I made for my app
3. AndroidApps/MyFirstApp/app/src/main/java/com/example/myfirstapp
This directory contains all of the java activity files for the app which include NewActivity.java for making an invoice for a fire incident and EditDelete.java for choosing to delete/edit previously created incidents.
